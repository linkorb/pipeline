Pipeline
========

Pipeline is a library + CLI tool to load programmable pipelines, execute jobs and get detailed results per stage for reporting/debugging.

## Concepts

* Pipeline: A sequential list of stages
* Stage: An command template with a unique name within the pipeline.
* Job: A job that will be executed on a pipeline with an optional set of input variables
* JobResult: The output of a Job that has been executed on a pipeline, contains status and a StageResult for each stage in the pipeline
* StageResult: The exact command that was executed, it's exitcode, stdout and stderr.

## CLI example

    bin/pipeline run examples/bbc-news-demo.pipeline.yml -d topic=technology
    bin/pipeline run examples/bbc-news-stdin-demo.pipeline.yml < examples/bbc-news-demo.rss.xml

This will load the specified pipeline and execute it with input variable `topic=technology` or send input on STDIN

## Library example

Please refer to `examples/example-code.php` on how to use the pipeline package as a library.
